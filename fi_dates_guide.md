# Strike Date

The strike date (also known as the fixing date or expiration date) refers to the specific date on which the strike price of an option contract is determined. The strike price is the price at which the underlying asset can be bought (in the case of a call option) or sold (in the case of a put option) if the option is exercised.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its relevance:

- **Options Contracts:** In the context of options, the strike date is crucial as it marks the date when the strike price is set. This price remains fixed throughout the life of the option.
  
- **Interest Rate Swaps and Other Derivatives:** For interest rate swaps and similar financial derivatives, the strike date might refer to the date when the relevant interest rate or other financial variable is determined for calculating payments.
  
- **Structured Products:** In structured financial products, the strike date can indicate when certain conditions or benchmarks are set, influencing the returns or payout structure of the product.

**Synonyms:** Strike Date / Initial Valuation Date / Initial Setting Date / Interest Strike Date / Fixing Date / Price Determination Date / Rate Fixing Date / Rate Set Date

**How to Identify in Term Sheets:**
- Look for phrases like "the price will be set on," "the strike price is determined on," or "the initial valuation occurs on."
- Typically found in sections detailing key dates, valuation terms, or pricing information.

# Expiry Date

The expiration date in financial contexts refers to the date on which a derivative contract, such as an option or a futures contract, becomes void and the right to exercise it no longer exists. After this date, the contract has no value. Here are some key points about the expiration date:

- **Options Contracts:** For options, the expiration date is the last date on which the holder of the option can exercise their right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) the underlying asset at the predetermined strike price. If the option is not exercised by the expiration date, it expires worthless.
  
- **Futures Contracts:** In futures trading, the expiration date is the date on which the contract must be settled, either by delivering the underlying asset or by cash settlement.
  
- **Warrants and Structured Products:** Similar to options, warrants and certain structured products also have expiration dates, after which they can no longer be exercised or redeemed.
  
- **Significance:** The expiration date is crucial for traders and investors as it determines the timeframe within which they need to make decisions regarding exercising or closing out their positions. The value and strategy associated with holding the derivative are heavily influenced by the time remaining until the expiration date.

**Synonyms:** Redemption Valuation Date / Final Valuation Date / Specified Valuation Date / Specified Final Valuation Date / Valuation Date(i) / Valuation Date(s) / Maturity Date / Expiry Date

**How to Identify in Term Sheets:**
- Look for terms like "expires on," "valid until," "the maturity date is," or "the final valuation date."
- Usually found in sections discussing the duration, maturity, or termination conditions of the contract.

# Knock-In/Knock-Out Determination Day

A Knock-In/Knock-Out Determination Day is a specific term used in the context of barrier options, which are a type of exotic option. These options include additional conditions that determine whether or not the option becomes active or expires worthless based on the performance of the underlying asset relative to a predetermined barrier level.

- **Knock-In Options:** The option becomes active (knocks in) if the underlying asset reaches a certain barrier level.
- **Knock-Out Options:** The option becomes void (knocks out) if the underlying asset reaches a certain barrier level.

**Synonyms:** Knock-in Determination Day(s) / Knock-out Determination Day(s) / Redemption Barrier Observation Date / Barrier Reference Date / Barrier Observation Date / Activation Date / Deactivation Date / Trigger Date / Barrier Event Date

**How to Identify in Term Sheets:**
- Look for phrases like "if the underlying reaches," "upon reaching the barrier," "activation occurs when," or "deactivation happens if."
- Typically found in sections outlining the conditions for activation or deactivation of the option, often in the product features or terms and conditions.
