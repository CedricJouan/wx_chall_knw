# Understanding Different Dates in Term Sheets of Financial Products

This guide provides detailed definitions and identification methods for various dates found in the term sheets of financial products. These dates are crucial for understanding the timeline and specific conditions of financial agreements.

## Key Date Definitions

**Issue Date:** The date on which the financial product is issued to the investor. This date marks the start of the contract and is often found under the section titled "Issue Date" in the term sheet.

*Example:* 
"Issue Date: 15 July 2021"


**Trade Date:** The date on which the transaction or trade is executed. This date precedes the issue date and is critical for determining when the terms of the trade were agreed upon.

*Example:* 
"Trade Date: 21 June 2021"


**Strike Date:** The date on which the strike price (the predetermined price at which an option can be exercised) is set. This date is crucial for options and other derivative contracts. The strike date can also be referred to as the initial valuation date or the valuation date at time 0, setting the baseline value for the financial product.

*Examples:*
"Strike Date: 30 June 2021"
"Initial Valuation Date: 1 April 2021"
"Valuation Date(0): 27 November 2020"


**Valuation Date:** The date on which the value of the underlying asset or the financial product is determined. It can appear as an initial valuation date, final valuation date, or in a series of periodic valuation dates. While the initial valuation date (or valuation date at time 0) is often the same as the strike date, other valuation dates may occur throughout the life of the product.

*Examples:* 
"Valuation Date(1): 27 November 2024"
"Valuation Date(2): 27 November 2025"


**Determination Date:** The date on which certain conditions or terms of the financial product are determined or finalized.

*Example:* 
"Determination Date: 23 June 2021"


**Maturity Date:** The date on which the financial product matures, meaning the principal amount is due to be paid back to the investor, along with any final interest or returns.

*Example:* 
"Maturity Date: Scheduled Maturity Date is December 3, 2025."


**Redemption Valuation Date:** The date on which the value of the financial product is determined for redemption purposes. This date is used to calculate the amount payable upon redemption.

*Example:* 
"Redemption Valuation Date: 17 June 2030."


**Settlement Date:** The date on which the transaction is completed, and the final exchange of funds and financial instruments occurs.

*Example:* 
"Settlement Date: 08 December 2027"


**Observation Dates:** Specific dates on which the performance of the underlying asset is observed. These dates are relevant for structured products with features like averaging or lookback options.

*Example:* 
"Observation Dates: Not applicable."


## Identifying Dates in Term Sheets

To accurately identify and extract these dates from term sheets, follow these steps:

1. **Look for Sections and Headings:** Dates are often listed under specific sections with clear headings like "Issue Date," "Trade Date," "Valuation Date," etc.
2. **Read Contextual Sentences:** Sometimes, dates are mentioned within sentences that describe their relevance or applicability, such as "Initial Valuation Date: 18 January 2022."
3. **Check Tabulated Information:** Term sheets often present dates in tables for clarity. Look for columns or rows specifically designated for dates.
4. **Pay Attention to Punctuation and Formatting:** Dates may be formatted in various ways (e.g., "27 November 2020" or "November 27, 2020"). Be attentive to different formats.
5. **Understand Definitions:** Knowing the exact definition of each date type helps in correctly identifying them, especially when multiple dates are listed close together.
